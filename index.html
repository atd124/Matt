                <b>ROOMMATE:</b><i>  Anything on TV?</i>

                <br></br>

                <b>ME:</b><i>  Social Network is on.</i> 

                <br></br>

                <b>ROOMMATE:</b> <i>Oh!  Social Network.  Love that movie.</i>
                
                <br></br>

                <b>ME:</b>  <i>I can stream it anytime but when it’s on live TV I watch it.  I don’t know why.  It’s just one of those movies, like Good Will Hunting and Shawshank.</i>
                
                <br></br>

                <b>ROOMMATE:</b>  <i>You know none of those movies won Best Picture.</i>
                
                <br></br>

                <b>ME:</b>  [Sigh.]  <i>I know.  Wait, who won over Social Network?</i><br></br>
                
                <b>ROOMMATE:</b> <i>I don't know, let me check.</i>  [Pause.]  <i>The King's Speech.</i>
                    
                <br></br>

                <b>ME:</b>  <i>Oh yea, The King's Speech.  Forgot about that movie.</i></p>

                <p class="article__text">How many times has an exchange like this occurred?  Matt Damon and my roommate would argue it happens too often—with too many Best Picture winners.  Like Mad Libs you can insert other Best Picture winners from that era and the dialogue would be similar.  The beginning:  Who won that year?  The middle:  Wait, who won?  The end:  Oh yea, right; <b>forgot about that movie.</b></p>  

                <h2>Wait, who won that year?</h2> 

                <p class="article__text">In 2010, Matt Damon suggested the Oscars wait 10 years before awarding Best Picture.  Now that enough time has passed, we revisit the idea and conclude that maybe Matt wasn't acting in <i>Good Will Hunting</i>.  Maybe he is a genius.  But first, some context and a couple assumptions about Best Picture.  
                
                <br></br>
                    
                <b>1.</b>  What exactly did Matt say in 2010?</p>

                <p class="caption">"They should give them out 10 years later, like the way they do the Hall of Fame in baseball. They do it in five years, but if you did 10 years later, if this year (2010), we were voting on what was the best picture of 2000, I think it would be much more honest. It's like, when you pick up great old movies and you go, why the hell didn't Brando win the Oscar for this one? Who won that year? Whatever the sizzle was about that year. 50 years later you're looking at a movie and going, this is a historic cinematic performance."</p>

                <p class="article__text">  <b>2.</b>  Best Picture isn't about that momentary, manufactured, "sizzle."  The spirit of Best Picture is indeed about historic relevance and cultural impact.</p>
                    
                <hr class="line-divider my-5 py-lg-2" />     

                <p class="blockquote font-secondary ">“They should give them out 10 years later, like the way they do the Hall of Fame in baseball.”</p>
        
                  <hr class="line-divider my-5 py-lg-2" />  

                  <br></br>

                    <h3>Google Trends</h3> 
                    <p class="article__text">Enter Google Trends.  But what does it measure and how does it work?  Google Trends gives you a normalized measure of search volume for a given search term over a selected period of time.  According to Google, each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents to compare relative popularity.  Otherwise, places with the most search volume would always be ranked highest.  The resulting numbers are then scaled on a range of 0 to 100 based on a topic’s proportion to all searches on all topics.

                    <h2>And the winner is...</h2> 
                    
                    <p class="article__text">The numbers and methodology may be unclear, at first, but what’s important is that Google Trends is a widely accepted proxy measure for public interest.  In this case (back to Matt) we can compare movies awarded Best Picture during that era with nominees and see the relative difference in public interest; a signal to answer our core question:  Ten plus years later, did these movies have an enduring impact?  As the following charts illustrate, the answer is no.  <b>The Best Picture Winners lost.</b>  And it's not close.</p>
