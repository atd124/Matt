#### *Over a decade ago, Matt Damon offered the Academy a provocative idea. Wait 10 years before awarding Best Picture. He was rightâ€”and Google Trends can prove it.*

Google Trends is a widely accepted proxy measure for public interest. In this case, we can compare movies awarded Best Picture during that era with nominees and see the relative difference in public interest; a signal to answer our core question: Ten plus years later, did these movies have an enduring impact?
